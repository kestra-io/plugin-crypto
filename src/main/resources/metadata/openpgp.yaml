description: "Tasks that encrypt and decrypt files with OpenPGP, including optional signing and signature verification."
body: "Encrypt accepts a source file (`from`), recipient list, and ASCII-armored public keys, and can sign the output when given signing keys and a passphrase; Decrypt takes the encrypted file, a private key with optional passphrase, and can validate signatures against allowed users. Both tasks stream files through Kestra storage and return the resulting file URI for downstream processing."
